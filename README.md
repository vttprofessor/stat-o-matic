The Stat-O-Matic is the perfect companion for D&D players building a new character! It streamlines the task of assigning ability scores and allows multiple methods that fits your game, whether you like a ton of randomness, maximum power, or total control.
This tool supports all the classic and most-used methods for getting your stats ready for adventure:

4d6 Drop the Lowest: The most common method. Roll four six-sided dice and drop the lowest result. 

3d6 (Standard Roll): Roll three six-sided dice. 

3d6 Down the Line: The old school classic, roll three dice six times, and those scores are assigned in order.

Standard Array: Skip the rolling! Everyone starts with the same balanced set of points (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) that you can assign however you like. Perfect for balance. 

Point Buy: The ultimate way to customize. You get a pool of points to "buy" your scores, letting you perfectly dial in your character's strengths and weaknesses without letting the dice decide. 

The DM picks the method best suited for their campaign in the settings.
