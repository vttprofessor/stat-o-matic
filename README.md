Make assigning ability scores a breeze! 

The Stat-O-Matic is the perfect tool for D&D players building a new character! It streamlines the task of assigning ability score points and allows multiple methods that fits your campaign.

*   **4d6 Drop the Lowest:** The most common method. Roll four six-sided dice and drop the lowest result. 
    
*   **3d6 (Standard Roll):** Roll three six-sided dice. 
    
*   **3d6 Down the Line:** The old school classic, roll three dice six times, and those scores are assigned in order.
    
*   **Standard Array:** Everyone starts with the same balanced set of ability points (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) that a player can assign however they like. 
    
*   **Point Buy:** The player gets a pool of ability points to "buy", allowing for the most customization for your character. 
    

The DM picks the method best suited for their campaign in the settings.
